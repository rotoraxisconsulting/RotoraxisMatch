# User Flows V2 — RotoraxisMatch

## 1. Technician registration and profile setup

1. User opens app → selects "I am a technician".
2. Creates account (email + password in future auth; demo mode uses local session).
3. Fills profile:
   - firstName, lastName, birthDate
   - technicianType
   - city, country, baseAirport (optional)
   - licenses (if mechanic or avionic)
   - habilitations per license (optional)
   - aircraft experience per type (hours or years)
   - availability (immediately / date / contract types)
   - social links (optional)
4. Uploads documents (license scan, medical, ID, etc.).
5. Profile is in `verificationStatus: pending` until admin verifies.
6. Profile appears in company search only after minimum admin verification.

---

## 2. Company registration and team setup

1. Company account/member is created manually for the MVP (demo/platform admin operation).
2. Company profile is completed with:
   - name, companyType, country, city, phone, email
3. First manually created member becomes company `admin`.
4. Additional company members can be manually created with `recruiter` or `viewer` role.
5. Company appears in the system after admin verification.

No self-service company invitations, invite links, invite tokens, or email invite flows are part of the MVP.

---

## 3. Company publishes a job offer

1. Company user (admin or recruiter) goes to "Job Offers" section.
2. Creates new offer:
   - title, description
   - contractType
   - location
   - requiredTechnicianTypes, requiredLicenses, requiredAircraftTypes
   - minYearsExperience
   - expiresAt (optional)
3. Saves as `draft` or publishes (`status: published`, `visible: true`).
4. Published offer appears in technician job search.
5. Company can close or edit the offer at any time.

---

## 4. Company searches technicians

**Matching rule: a match % is only shown when an offer is selected. Browsing without an offer shows no score.**

### 4a. Offer-centric path (recommended)
1. Company opens a published job offer.
2. Opens "Find Technicians for this Offer".
3. App calls `getTechnicianMatchesForOffer(offerId)` and shows ranked results.
4. Each technician card shows **"X% match for this offer"**.
5. Company can send a direct offer (linked to the open job offer).

### 4b. General technician search (no offer context)
1. Company navigates to "Find Technicians" without selecting an offer.
2. Applies filters: technicianType, licenses, aircraftTypes, availability, location, verificationStatus.
3. Results show anonymous profiles. **No match % is shown.** Cards say **"Select an offer to calculate match"**.
4. Company can still send a direct offer (without a linked job offer).

**Direct offer screen:**
- Company sees: anonymousCode, age, technicianType, licenses, habilitations, experience, availability.
- If an offer was pre-selected, the match score for that offer is shown.
- Company writes optional message.
- Company sends offer → OfferRequest created with `status: pending`.

## 5. Technician searches job offers

**Browse Offers is for discovery only. My Applications is for history.**

### 5a. Browse Offers (discovery)
1. Technician navigates to "Browse Offers".
2. Applies filters: contractType, requiredLicenses, requiredAircraftTypes, location.
3. App calls `getOfferMatchesForTechnician(technicianId)` — **only `published` + `visible` offers are returned**.
4. Each offer card shows **"X% match with your profile"** (score is offer-specific).
5. Technician opens offer detail: title, description, requirements, location, contract type, **match score prominently displayed**.
6. Technician applies:
   - Optional cover note.
   - OfferApplication created with `status: pending`.
   - **One application per technician per offer.** If an application already exists (any status), no second application can be created. Reapplication is out of scope for MVP.
7. Company receives notification of application.

> Closed, expired, and draft offers never appear in Browse Offers. Offer visibility controls discovery only — existing applications and accepted relationships are not affected when an offer closes.

### 5b. My Applications (history)
1. Technician navigates to "My Applications".
2. Screen loads **all** offer applications for this technician via `getForTechnician()` — independent of offer status.
3. Each entry shows: offer title, company name, application status, offer status (if not published), applied date.
4. Technician can open the offer detail from history (shows historical context for closed/expired offers).
5. Accepted applications show a direct "Open chat" link.
6. Withdrawn/rejected/expired applications remain permanently in history — no reapplication.

> My Applications is the canonical technician application history. It never disappears when a linked offer closes.

---

## 6. Technician reviews received direct offers

1. Technician navigates to "Direct Offers".
2. The list shows:
   - **Pending** direct offers whose linked offer is still `published` + `visible` — shown as actionable.
   - **Accepted** direct offers — always shown regardless of whether the linked offer is still active (established relationship, chat accessible).
   - **Rejected / expired / withdrawn** — shown in history, sorted below pending and accepted.
   - **Pending** direct offers whose linked offer is now closed/unpublished — hidden from the list (not actionable).
3. Opens offer detail:
   - Company name, position details, match score with profile.
   - If the linked offer has been closed since the direct offer was sent, a "Offer closed" banner appears and Accept is disabled.
   - For accepted offers (even if the linked offer has since closed), full offer details and match score are shown for historical context.
4. Technician accepts or rejects (only for pending + linked offer still active).
5. On acceptance: identity and admin-verified documents are unlocked for the company; a chat room is created.

> **Visibility rule for direct offers:** only pending actionability is tied to the linked offer's current status. Accepted relationships persist regardless of offer lifecycle. Records are never deleted — admin and company history show all records.

---

3. No chat is created.
4. Identity remains locked.
5. Documents remain locked.

---

## 10. Chat flow

- Chat is accessible only from an accepted OfferRequest or OfferApplication.
- No chat screen is visible before acceptance.
- Both parties (technician and company user) can send messages.
- Company viewers cannot send messages (read-only role).
- Messages are stored in ChatMessages linked to the ChatRoom.

---

## 11. Document unlock flow

- Documents are locked by default — companies cannot see them.
- On offer acceptance: `documentsUnlocked` → `true` automatically.
- `documentsUnlocked = true` means the company may access **eligible** documents — not every document row.
- **Company sees only verified documents** (status = `verified`). Pending, rejected, and expired documents remain visible to the technician and admin only.
- Document files (URLs) are only accessible for verified documents when `documentsUnlocked = true`.

**Access by role:**
| Document status | Technician (own) | Company (after accepted) | Admin |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------|
| `verified` | ✅ visible | ✅ visible | ✅ visible |
| `pending` | ✅ visible | ❌ not visible | ✅ visible |
| `rejected` | ✅ visible (+ rejection reason) | ❌ not visible | ✅ visible |
| `expired` | ✅ visible | ❌ not visible | ✅ visible |

---
