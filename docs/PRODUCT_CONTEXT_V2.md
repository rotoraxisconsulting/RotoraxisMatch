# Product Context V2 — RotoraxisMatch

RotoraxisMatch V2 is a bidirectional aviation marketplace connecting verified technicians with companies, MROs, airlines, operators, and recruitment agencies.

## Marketplace model

V2 is **bidirectional** — two independent directions:

| Direction | Actor | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Company → Technician | Company | Searches anonymous profiles, sends direct offer |
| Technician → Job Offer | Technician | Browses published offers, applies |

Both paths converge into the same acceptance flow.

## Roles

- **Technician** — creates profile, applies to offers, receives direct offers from companies
- **Company** — multi-user organization; publishes offers, searches technicians, sends direct offers
- **Admin** — verifies users and documents, reviews reports, can block users

## Technician types

| Type | License required |
|------|-----------------|
| mechanic | Yes (Part-66 A or B1.x) |
| avionic | Yes (Part-66 B2 or B2L) |
| sheet_metal_worker | No |
| painter | No |
| composite | No |
| pilot | Standby — not active in V2 |

## Licenses (EASA Part-66)

A1, A2, A3, A4, B1.1, B1.2, B1.3, B1.4, B2, B2L, B3, L, C

## Aircraft habilitations

- A habilitation is a type rating tied to a specific license category.
- A technician can hold a license without any habilitation.
- Aircraft experience is stored per aircraft type regardless of whether a habilitation exists.
- Experience and habilitation are separate fields.

## Matching model

**A match score is always calculated for a specific Offer + Technician pair.**
The same technician can score 90% for Offer A and 30% for Offer B.
Match scores are never stored on a technician profile.

### Company UX
- The main matching view is **offer-centric**: the company selects or opens an offer, then sees technicians ranked by match % for that specific offer.
- Each technician card says **"X% match for this offer"**.
- If the company browses technicians without selecting an offer, no match % is shown. The card says **"Select an offer to calculate match"**.

### Technician UX
- When a technician browses published offers, each offer card shows **"X% match with your profile"**.
- The score uses the same calculation function.

### Never show a match % without knowing the offer it belongs to.
Every displayed match score must be tied to a specific `offerId` + `technicianId` pair.

### Scoring criteria
1. verificationStatus = verified → +25
2. At least one habilitation matches required aircraft types → +25
3. At least one license matches required licenses → +20
4. Availability contractTypes includes offer contractType → +15
5. Total aircraft experience ≥ minYearsExperience → +10
6. Same city or base airport as offer location → +5
7. **Maximum: 100**
